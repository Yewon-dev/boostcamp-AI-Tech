# Multi-modal Learning

### 1. Overview of multi-modal learning

- Different representations between modalities
- Unbalance between heterogeneous feature spaces
- May a model be biased on a specific modality

### 2. Multi-modal tasks (1) - Visual data & Text

- Word2vec : Skip-gram model을 사용하여 word embedding 
- Joint embedding
  - Image tagging : Combining pre-trained unimodal models
  - Image & food recipe retrieval
- Cross modal translation
  - Image Captioning
  - Show, attend, and tell
  - Text-to-image by generative model
- Cross modal reasoning
  - Visual question answering

### 3. Multi-modal tasks (2) - Visual data & Audio

- Sound representation
  - Short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
  - Spectrogram
- Joint embedding
  - Scene recognition by sound
    - SoundNet
- Cross modal translation
  - Speech2face
  - Image-to-speech synthesis
- Cross modal reasoning
  - Sound source localization
  - Live movements generation
